# Waterfall Chart
A waterfall chart is a form of data visualization that helps in understanding the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. These intermediate values can either be time based or category based. The waterfall chart is also known as a flying bricks chart or Mario chart due to the apparent suspension of columns (bricks) in mid-air. Often in finance, it will be referred to as a bridge.

## Diagram Design / Configuration

### Binding
- The bindings required are Category and Value.

    >Category shows a name for a certain category. 

    >Value stores the amount of income or losses for a certain category

Based on binded values that come from Excel Sheet, several required values will be automatically calculated.
* These values are:
    * `Start Value` shows the existing amount before the current category is applied. This value will always be 0 for the first and last columns and is equal to 'End Value' of previuos category. 
    * `End Value` Value reflects the amount after the current category is applied. 'End Value' is a sum of 'Value' and 'Start Value'
    * `Color` binding which binds the color of the nodes. It is always red for negative values, green for positive values and blue for first and last columns.
    * `Display Label` that shows the difference between amounts before and after a category is applied. This is equal to Value.
